# roglik
Roglik - mini-roguelike (coffeebreak) game with complete information (player possess full information about the opponents) designed to provide 5-7 minute game session on which you will be able to win the game.

It's pretty raw pre-alpha, but you can already give it a try :)

To compile yourself:
1) install MinGW https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/ and PDCurses
2) gcc -Wall -Wextra main.c -o main.exe -lpdcurses

Initially it was made for tutorial purposes as part of C language tutorial at my channel: https://youtube.com/ITPhD , but eventually I've decided to make it 'playable'. Check full C language tutorial playlist to understand how it works:
